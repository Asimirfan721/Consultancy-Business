    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 space-y-4 text-gray-700 mb-10">
        <li>
            <strong>Research and Find a Suitable Program:</strong> Start by exploring public universities in Italy that offer your preferred course. Check if IELTS or other English proficiency certificates are accepted, or if you qualify for exemptions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Apply and Secure Admission:</strong> Submit your application as per the university’s deadline. Once accepted, you’ll receive a letter of admission or pre-acceptance.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Pre-Enrollment on Universitaly:</strong> When the Universitaly portal opens (usually around mid-year), submit your details. The university will forward your pre-enrollment summary to your local Italian embassy/consulate.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Start Preparing for Visa:</strong> Begin gathering visa documentation based on the official checklist from your embassy’s website. Ensure you prepare all translations and notarizations.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Choose a Sponsor:</strong> You can either self-sponsor (if employed/self-employed) or use a blood relative as a sponsor. Your sponsor must provide recent bank statements, relationship proof, and income documentation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Book Your Visa Appointment:</strong> Watch the embassy portal for new appointments and act fast. Delays are common due to high demand.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Apply for Regional Scholarship:</strong> Parallel to visa processing, research regional scholarships like LazioDisco, EDISU Piemonte, or DSU Toscana. These offer accommodation and financial support.
        </li>
    </ol>
